        <h1>What is it?</h1>
        <p>In Git, branches are a part of your everyday development process. Basically, Git branches are a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. Branching gives you the chance to clean up your future's history before merging it into the main branch.</p>

        <h1>Why is it?</h1>
        <p>When you are working on a particular feature inside a team of multiple programmers, you create your own branch and start working on it. So that, everyone does not have to see your unfinished work. After you complete your feature, you then ask for merging it into main branch.</p>

        <h1>How it works?</h1>
        <p>A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history. New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.</p>
        <p>The git branch command lets you create, list, rename, and delete branches. It doesn’t let you switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. For this reason, git branch is tightly integrated with the git checkout and git merge commands.</p>

        <h1>Creating branches-</h1>
        <p>It's important to understand that branches are just pointers to commits. When you create a branch, all Git needs to do is create a new pointer, it doesn’t change the repository in any other way. The repository history remains unchanged. All you get is a new pointer to the current commit. Note that this only creates the new branch. To start adding commits to it, you need to select it with git checkout, and then use the standard git add and git commit commands.</p>
